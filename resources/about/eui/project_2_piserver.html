        <p>This server has been powering my personal cloud service ever since I'd set it up</p>
        <p>
          On the spec sheet, it sports a 1.0 GHz quad core ARM chip, this proves to be plenty for light file and web server duty. It also serves as my IRC bouncer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a pinch, is is also used as my quick collaborative LAN server. any game we want to play could be hosted on this little thing and most would run just fine without any slowdowns or hiccups.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days the only times it ever goes down are when the power goes out, due to me not having a UPS to keep it going.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the machine runs a version of linux called DietPi, which is designed to reduce resource demand as much as possible, allowing the machine to serve 4 different servers at once without too much fuss.
