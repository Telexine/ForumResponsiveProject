          I have the need to chat, but I don't have a headset, so the best I could do was to put a microphone somewhere close by on the desk. However prople started complaining about the noises from my keyboard, so I started to form a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept is simplicity itself, get an adjustable desk lamp, slap a quarter-inch thread common mount onto it, and put the microphone on that. The execution is a bit more complicated.

        <p>
          The lamp itself is mounted to the table by a series of cable ties, in order to not have to drill through the desk. The cables are routed along the arm itself, to reduce clutter. The mount is hot-glued to the end of the lamp, which means it is cleanly removeable if one tries hard enough.
